# CIFAR Image Classification

This project focuses on image classification using the CIFAR dataset, employing deep learning models to recognize objects in images. The work demonstrates model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions using popular libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

## Dataset

The CIFAR dataset is a collection of images commonly used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size and falls into one of the 10 categories.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Deep learning model implementation (e.g., CNN)
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of predictions
- Model accuracy and performance analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
